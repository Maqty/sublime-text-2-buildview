Improvements:
 - closing the build output view, directly, or indirectly, eg. by exiting
   Sublime Text, no longer causes a "Save changes?" warning to be displayed.

   If you wish to have the old behaviour (of having a warning displayed), set
   `buildview_silence_modified_warning` in your settings; see `README.md` for
   details.

   Thanks to pull #8 by @wrsaunde
